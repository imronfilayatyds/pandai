I have done some simple analysis to this data. <br>
I obtained this data from Kaggle, it is called [Denpasar Weather Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cornflake15/denpasarbalihistoricalweatherdata?resource=download)<br> <br> <br>

Here's one of the plots I made. This is about temperature vs humidity.<br>
